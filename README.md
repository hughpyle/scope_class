# Signals and Scopes


Class at the Brickyard Collaborative


### Goals:
Learn about electrical signals using oscilloscopes and function generators.


#### See and hear and measure waves.
* Relationship between time and frequency and wavelength.
* Using the scope controls (one-channel)
* Triggers
* DC and AC coupling
* Measuring voltage
* Measuring frequency

#### Different types of signals
* Sine waves
* Square, triangle, sawtooth, pulse, and other regular shapes
* Modulation
* What music looks like.
* Maybe: play with some analog filters?  R/L/C

#### Two-channel scopes
* An intro to some Digital signals (serial data & word-clock)
* X-Y mode
* Lissajous / Bowditch figures
* Drawing pictures in X-Y mode
